55256,223443645,1-1-2018,104838,April,Very large room in a central location.  Lotte was easy to communicate with both prior to and while we were there. Thanks!
96048,223519984,1-1-2018,157316164,Bobby,Well kept home. Rooms and beds are tiny. Not sure if the value is worth the price. Our host and location were great. Tuhami provide Tea and a hot pot which was lovely. His home is beautiful which made me want to avoid the historical house even more so. Great location near the trains and metro.

11609099,224049035,2-1-2018,39392622,YiChien,Location is quite nice. you can take tram or bus. but I recommend tram. the bus make me dizziness. The stairs in Amsterdam seems all small and steep. Be careful when you carry a big suitcase. The private room at Anne's house is very comfortable. Bathroom is very clean. And we also use the kitchen for prepare our meals. Anne is a wonderful host. She even invite us to join the year end dinner with her friends. We got a great vacation in Amsterdam.

11809899,224087453,2-1-2018,25254117,Benjamin,Really nice apartment with a beautiful decoration. Not far from the center and many shops near by. I Had a really good time in this flat. Thank you cali.
11830596,224038866,2-1-2018,27193727,Ali,Jonna is such a great host. Her flat is big enough to stay as a 2 couple with having privacy. All rooms have daylight which is really important in Netherlands. You have everything in the kitchen that you need to prepare your meals. We recommend Jonna's apartment for your Amsterdam trip.
11882378,224025475,2-1-2018,36509176,Marie,Very nice flat. it's perfect for a couple. Near  to the center of Amsterdam. clean and good equipement. Thanks Els for her host and I recommend.
11966081,224134613,2-1-2018,104381739,Antonio,El apartamento está bien y es muy cómodo.  La única pega es la distancia al centro. Barrio tranquilo con tren y metro cerca.
11966183,223999738,2-1-2018,110818660,Chady,It was a nice trip. it is a nice place next to the center. we really appreciate the property of this place and it wasn't that expensive for a trip during the winter break mostly during the new year. Thanks a lot Tjerk and hope to see you soon!
12058561,224113092,2-1-2018,39478256,Bowen,Dina and max were very helpful during the stay. Remember to ask if you have any questions. they will provide you with great tips like dining and transportation. Btw. there are many great restaurants nearby!!
12099302,224047237,2-1-2018,157177279,Efe,5 minutes away walking  from metro station and reach the centraal station is aprroximately 10 minutes.so classy neighbour

12251311,223957008,2-1-2018,28916655,Noémie,Nous étions entre amis pour fêter le nouvel an. L'appartement est très fonctionnel avec une super déco. Manon a été très chaleureuse envers nous et nous a donné quelques conseils sur la ville. Nous sommes très contents de notre séjour chez elle.
12300663,224026583,2-1-2018,57650641,Yasser,Great location. lovely apartment.
12321072,224125173,2-1-2018,143554752,Emma,We had a great time celebrating the new year at Karins home! We felt very welcome and had our own privacy for the whole stay! Watching the fireworks as the new year came in from the jacuzzi was a highlight! Thanks for a lovely experience. would definitely recommend! Public transport to the location is easy enough using the tram!
12347938,224050866,2-1-2018,86311629,Olivia,Perfect location to visit Amsterdam! :)
12372306,223978417,2-1-2018,72290297,Aljoscha,Wir hatten echt eine wunderschöne Zeit in Amsterdam bei Stefania! Die Wohnung ist super gut gelegen und wir konnten viele Ziele fußläufig erreichen. Die Wohnung ist stilvoll eingerichtet und wir würden herzlich mit einem kleinen Geschenk empfangen. Auf dem Tisch war eine liebevoll geschriebene Broschüre was wir in Amsterdam machen können und worauf man achten sollte. Der Check-In hat auch super funktioniert. in dem wir im Café schräg gegenüber den hinterlegten Schlüssel abgeholt haben. Es ist schon etwas hellhörig in der Wohnung. Aber das war nicht weiter schlimm! Wir können einen Aufenthalt nur empfehlen
12415931,224062581,2-1-2018,93547513,Tereza,The place was lovely. cozy and stylish. It is a studio flat but perfect for a couple or a 3/4 friends. The bathroom is modern. there is everything you could possibly need in the studio(hairdryer. washing machine. ironing board. dishwasher etc.) and the area we were in felt very safe. It was also close to all the places we wanted to visit(central. museums). Lily gave great recommendations for food. drinks. shopping and there are plenty of books about Amsterdam in the flat both in Dutch and English that you can read if you further need more information. Overall we had a great time and would definitely stay again. Many thanks for having us in your cute warm cozy place :-) xx
12444222,224013750,2-1-2018,93219881,Julia,Excelente ubicación. desayuno completo y  amabilidad del personal. Muy recomendable !
12534679,224023518,2-1-2018,134415194,Mathieu,Friendly atmosphere and host ! The room is big. The flat is clean and quiet.  Everything available for coffee and tea in the room.
12578052,223973023,2-1-2018,48707345,Lea,Wohnung ist nicht mit einer „Luxuswohnung“ zu vergleichen. Die Wohnung ist sauber. aber die Toilette macht echt kein Spaß. Gerade auf der Toilette sitzen ist für große Menschen nur erschwert möglich! Verspäteter Check-in (1 Stunde später wie angekündigt) erschwerte die Ankunft. Zudem müssen einige Maßnahmen zur Reinigung bei Check-out erledigt werden. die eigentlich von der Reinigungsgebühr abgezogen gehört. Die Wohnung liegt nicht zentral. Man brauch mindestens 20 Minuten in die Stadt. Der Aufenthalt war ok.
12579177,224107352,2-1-2018,36558618,Murilo,Otimo lugar. hosts e atendentes otimos e super bem localizado.

12772984,223974494,2-1-2018,122930139,Wael,It was great we loved everything about the place. Highly recommended for everyone who wants to enjoy their time in Amsterdam.
12840460,224045200,2-1-2018,62220995,Amy,Amazing stay we will definitely recommend staying here! Great location and beautiful little apartment! Very thoughtful and helpful host!
12865495,224015075,2-1-2018,106639750,Priscila,Muy cálida bienvenida y delicioso desayuno. Además de una conveniente ubicación.
12879304,224022029,2-1-2018,156628149,Nikos,Beautyful. peaceful and very comfortable house only 15 minutes by tram from the city centre. Some bedrooms offer a great view at the canal! I sure you will enjoy your stay.
12881012,223965377,2-1-2018,157892955,Alexandra,Séjour agréable dans un charmant appartement la verrière est un grand plus mais je l'avoue le plus difficile ce sont les escaliers à la mode hollandaise petit et étroit
12908561,223954466,2-1-2018,55811741,Akash,Great locality right in the middle of central Amsterdam's most buzzing place. Wonderful hospitality by the host. Be prepared. as the rooms are compact but true to the pictures shown. Also. be aware of the narrow steep staircases just in case you are not familiar with the typical staircases in Amsterdam. There is no lift in the hotel. The rooms and common toilets/bathrooms were very clean.There is always some noise in the room due to its location and also the church opposite. There won't be much silence in the rooms at night as many coffeeshops. pubs. restaurants. adult clubs. etc. are in the vicinity.Overall. it was total value for money compared to the crazy hotel prices in Amsterdam.
13051355,224032809,2-1-2018,122870497,Jessica,Great location right near the red light district and close to bars and food places. The street itself was quiet which was welcome relief from tbe crowds. The rooms are lovely. clean and spacious and the mini bar is well stocked everyday :) Roof top terrace would be great in summer.... not so good in the rain  though. The stairs are a steep climb but you get used to it! All in all a good stay though comfortable and clean and a helpful host.
13090334,224067068,2-1-2018,72814224,Synnøve,We had a great stay in Marije's place. The appartment has everything you need for a stay in this beautiful city. Check in and check out was very easy and  Marije was very helpful  and flexible. The appartment has good location with great conection to the city center with several trams and buses that goes all the time. I can really recommend staying in this place!
13092978,223952868,2-1-2018,94243729,Tom,Great location!!!
13103861,223932474,2-1-2018,57932532,Shaun,Me and my wife stayed here to celebrate New Year. It was the third time we’ve stayed in Amsterdam for new year but the first time not using a hotel. We much preferred the extra space the attic provides and the good communication/hospitality from the hosts. It’s in a great location and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam. Thanks again !
13107524,223985119,2-1-2018,155369399,Milena,The flat was incredibly beautiful and super clean with all the extras one could dream of having. plus the bed was super comfortable with a great view of the Gracht. Mira‘s hospitality was one of a kind. I can wholeheartedly recommend this flat to anyone considering coming to the beautiful city of Amsterdam.
13164268,224094194,2-1-2018,15752454,Lisa,Comfortable house in a quiet and nice area in Amsterdam. Really kind hospitality. Amazing
13170633,224000855,2-1-2018,142179392,Maximilien,Warm welcome from Annette and a nice place to stay. The flat is in a quiet district and not far from the tram station going to the center (3min from tram).
13230530,224010482,2-1-2018,356343,Davlyn,We had a wonderful stay at Josee’s place! We were 2 couples and the layout allows for privacy as well as a comfortable common space. We were in walking distance of restaurants and cafes and a 15 min car ride into the center of the city. We were given a tour of the space upon arrival and all communication prior to arrival was quick and informative. Thank you!
13247868,224014087,2-1-2018,3874844,Jean-François,Cristian was a very good guest.His friends Bart who meet us was also really kind.The flat was perfect for 4 people. the shower is brand new. It‘s just a little far from the center - 30 min by tram.
13272633,224042028,2-1-2018,11301355,Artur,We had a great time on new year!!! Everything was fine. the reservation. the information. the location! We enjoyed our 2 day trip.
13353566,224108481,2-1-2018,24300254,Julia,Iris's home is a very good place to stay if you are a group of friends or a family. It's not in the center of Amsterdam but there's a bus at 10min from the house. The house is big and in a quiet lovely district. The only thing was stained sheets in one room but Iris found a solution. We recommend the house!
13406951,224111061,2-1-2018,47740228,William,Excellent location and property along with wonderful hosts.
13464429,224010608,2-1-2018,14279366,Laura,Huib is very kind. He allowed us to leave the luggages before check in. The apartment is very cosy and clean. It is next to the bus stop towards and from the central station. And in a very central position. We really enjoyed our stay in this place.
13471612,223967459,2-1-2018,57719062,Vineet,Great location. Awesome host!
13554389,224068076,2-1-2018,155903220,Lucie,Très bon accueil de la part de Bas et de sa femme par une bouteille de champagne ! L'appartement est parfait pour un séjour en famille ou entre amis. Le quartier est très calme et le centre d'Amsterdam n'est qu'a une dizaine de minutes a pied.
13737420,224090997,2-1-2018,46572144,Elisa,Florian's place is really comfortable for everyone: families. couples. friends. He's really nice and available at any time. ready to do everything he can to make you feel at home and avoid any trouble during your holiday.
13756626,223944218,2-1-2018,50150629,Arina,Victor’s place is amazing!Location - opposite the metro station. 1 min walk from it. 15 min to the city center by metro. direct line.The studio - It has EVERYTHING you need for a comfortable stay - all the dishes. coffeemaker. great oven etc.Everything was pristine clean and very stylish - we were actually trying to guess. who decorated the place. as we really liked the design and those small finish touches here and there)It is a studio. yet it easily accommodated 3 people and we didn’t feel like we lacked space!Victor was really friendly and gave us a lot of great advice for our stay! Will defo come back!
13764999,223983603,2-1-2018,164938017,Oliver,It was a pleasure to be hosted at Bobs apartment.We were there over NYE and we can really recommend Bob. He answers fast if we had questions. gave us helpful information and tips for Amsterdam.He is very hospitable. the apartment has everything you need and is very clean and comfortable.

Walking would take about 35 minutes.All in all. it was a great stay. wonderful apartment and a exemplary. super friendly and helpful host.Thank you Bob. highly recommend. hope we can stay at yours next time we visit Amsterdam
13807292,223955012,2-1-2018,135111067,Dylan,Séjours super agréable. le logement est irréprochable et très bien entretenu.L’hôte Juliette nous a très bien accueillie.nous y retournerons avec grand plaisir.
13852643,224068783,2-1-2018,153186992,Pierre-Étienne,Thanks for everything Willem. We had a lovely stay in your beautiful neighbourhood. We plan to be back each year to Amsterdam! Gen & PES
13954029,224125785,2-1-2018,8218326,Nina,We had a great experience! I spent New Years Eve in Amsterdam with friends. so we were lucky to find an apartment in such a great area! The apartment looks like the pictures and we felt very comfortable. The kitchen is also nice and we enjoyed cooking together. We were able to walk almost everywhere and the tram is not very far away as well. Janire always answered very fast and helped us in everything she could. We would love to come back :)
13965835,223945007,2-1-2018,69853573,Kemal,It was a great experience to stay in a houseboat. The accommodation is well located. Everything looks like on the pictures. Thank you again Geke ! :)
13972625,224133903,2-1-2018,57793450,Nick,Marieke's place was gorgeous. Great location near trams. easy to get in and out of the city. but the area around the apartment has a lot to offer. Came here over new year's and had such a great time.
13990928,224101780,2-1-2018,10218273,Catherine,This apartment is AWESOME! It represents everything that Airbnb should represent. a home away from home. it was like we found our Dutch counterparts with a home similar to our own.The space is fabulous and great for a longer stay in Amsterdam. we were able to relax and cook dinner there. Plus we were walking distance from everywhere. We'd love to go there in summer when we could also enjoy the large balcony space more as well! Big 10/10 for this apartment. and it was fab finding the perfect truly dutch home for our stay in Amsterdam. This includes the tiny and very steep stairs!
14054769,224127720,2-1-2018,67695198,Priscilla,Good location. big apartment with 3 rooms (2 double beds + one bed containing 2 foam mattresses). one bathroom with shower + bath + WC and one separated WC. The living room with the kitchen is spacious. Internet is working very well.Unfortunately during our stay. there were many problems like the cold coming inside the apartment (because some window cannot be close completely). some lack of cleaning in the communal areas... but the most important problem was the main door which didn't close (there was a written paper behind the door saying that the lock seems to have a problem and that we cannot close the door if we don't want to be locked outside) so we had to leave it everyday leaving our computers and all our stuff inside. We do have sent messages to the host but we didn't get an answer for that. we had to live with it. When we left the apartment. we mentioned again the problem to the person that made our check out (not the host. an hosting agency). and he didn't react. We didn't get angry or nothing when we spoke to him. but didn't even receive a goodbye when we left. 
14096751,223944640,2-1-2018,83770068,Kyle,Top marks all round! We had a perfect time in Amsterdam and with the apartment. The door and views open straight out to the canal. There is a tram right around the corner that brings you right into the city center. The apartment is warm. clean and as shown in the pictures. Daphne left plenty of direction for great places to see and trips to do. Daphne was super quick to respond to any questions we had and went out of her way to make sure we had a welcome stay. I would come back to this location next time I am in Amsterdam for sure.
14101273,224110355,2-1-2018,146715026,Dennis,Das Apartment befinden sich etwas außerhalb in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet. aber man kommt sehr gut mit der Tram in die Stadt. Die Wohnung ist gut ausgestattet und sieht aus wie auf den Bilder (allerdings ist das kleine Zimmer etwas kleiner als es wirkt).Für alle die ein nettes Apartment für zwei Personen suchen. kann ich es nur empfehlen
14109108,224015204,2-1-2018,23384759,Rebecca,Bianca is perfect and her home is like her ! We found a very pretty and cosy appartement with a very good localisation because it’s very central but also very quiet. All the flat is design with talent. Thank you for this lovely weekend ??
14157367,223986709,2-1-2018,58612372,Marko,Très bien situé. proche du centre centre avec une belle terrasse ! Cependant une autre personne est venue nous accueillir avec deux  sacs à la main. Celui ci faisait les lits pendant notre arrivée. Le ménage n'a pas été fait et il restait encore des traces des précédents locataires... De plus l'évacuation de l'air dans la sdb ne fonctionne pas et sans fenêtre nous étions dans un sauna
14158010,223953715,2-1-2018,51472826,Florent,Appartement familial idéal pour 4 personnes. Sa localisation est exceptionnelle en plein coeur du quartier vivant De Pijp. Excellente communication. Séjour réussi.
14159545,223952942,2-1-2018,163442162,Vincenz,We were expecting to be welcomed by such a kind host which was open to our questions and made it way easier for us to start with our Amsterdam trip. Not only did she know the answers but she recommended certain things and places.The apartment itself is very handsome and classy thanks to the art and the decoration. It is not far from the center and were pleased with the kitchen. the bathroom and even a small balcony.Thanks once more!
14171624,223961485,2-1-2018,75851852,Anais,Très jolie appartement qui correspond parfaitement aux photos. Ron est un très bon hôte qui est là même pendant le séjour pour répondre a nos questions sur la ville. L’emplacement est très bien proche du tramSuper séjour chez Ron
14190815,224007213,2-1-2018,22669566,Francesco,Appartamento tranquillo vicino a un canale nella zona residenziale orientale. 15 min da stazione centrale o sud. Comodo con 2 bus o meglio ancora in bici. Alto. luminoso e veramente abitato! Cucina con tutto il necessario. letto molto confortevole. Il bagno è normale. magari un po’ piccolo ma doccia comoda. Wi-Fi e tv ok. Carino anche il letto in più soprelevato. Il proprietario è gentilissimo e pronto a venire in contro su tutto.

15174612,223977904,2-1-2018,6719084,Dirk,Die Kommunikation war super. Die Wohnung ist schön und wie auf den Bildern. Direkt unten an der Straße ist ein Supermarkt. Im Viertel kann man gut Essen gehen und es gibt auch einige Bars in der Straße. Mit der Tram ins Zentrum zu kommen ist kein Problem. es befinden sich mehrere Haltestellen in Laufentfernung. Wir hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt dort.
15262729,224101309,2-1-2018,45165396,Christine,The apartment was very nice and cosy. The balcony view was really nice. especially on New Year's. The shower is in the same space as the bedroom so not really private. but curtains could be drawn. We really enjoyed our stay and Martin's parents were very welcoming and friendly. They gave us some Stroopwaffels which were very nice.

15442364,224041451,2-1-2018,27207542,Manuela,Where to start ? Well Sara’s place is spotless. The room size is decent and the amenities are clean and wide ( massive bathroom ) . The kitchen is really functional. And the Living room is the highlight of the flat. spacious light. with an hamac . We were 3 friends from France. meeting abroad to enjoy and live the Deutsch way for 4 days. Sara have a very good knowledge of her neighbour which is really convenient. then the flat is located 20/25 min to the Center. it’s really easy to get in town at any time of the day or night with public transports or taxi . Then there is Sara. she is the best Airbnb host ever. she knows how to make you feel comfortable. and she put so much effort on her flat to be welcoming that the only way it’s to leave it the same way.I will be back to Amsterdam. Thanks very much Sara to make our stay special. ??

15753136,224019848,2-1-2018,59559758,Shunny,We enjoyed our stay at Eric's place. the house is amazing and right by a quiet lake. Yes it's 1 metro ride to Centraal but the metro runs every 10mins usually so if you time it right (8mins walk to station). you can be central in 25- 30 mins or less from leaving the house. The red Metro line served us well! I highly recommend staying here as the house is beautiful and relaxing.
15781732,224124706,2-1-2018,57998425,Charlotte-Louisa,Excellent hosts. beautiful apartment which is bigger than the pictures look. It’s very close to public transport and very clean! Would definitely stay again!

Due to the fact that we stayed over New Years Eve they welcomed us with Sparkling wine. Stropwaffles and a nice card. The loft is designed in such a nice way that feeling like at home started directly after entering the loft. The location of the loft is very central but also very quite.
15816344,223982800,2-1-2018,20393331,Eeva-Lotta,Absolutely great venue for anyone with a taste for adventure and willingness to meet some great new people :)

Man hat seine Ruhe.Eine gut ausgestattete Unterkunft. Das Badezimmer ist super und die Küche für einige Gerichte bereit. Sollte es einem zu ruhig sein kann man über eine Anlage Musik abspielen. Im Wohnraum gibt es viele gemütliche Plätze.Das luxuriöse Frühstück. das die Gastgeberin anbietet. ist sehr lecker.Inge ist eine nette. zuvorkommende und offene Person. Man hat sich gern mit ihr  unterhalten. Sie kann auch etwas Deutsch. Wenn mir mal Fragen hatten oder Hilfe benötigten war sie immer für uns da. Sehr zuverlässig.

And all we can say is that everything was perfect. the location is directly in the center of amsterdam and the central station is 4 minutes away so you can get everywhere in a short time!

15950610,224137384,2-1-2018,95519897,Franck,Appartement très bien équipé. situé dans un quartier relativement calme. mais avec commerces et restaurants à proximité. La station de tram n'est qu'à quelques mètres à pied. pour se rendre en 10-15 minutes au centre-ville.L'appartement possède tout ce qui est nécessaire. Si il ne fallait trouver qu'un point négatif. c est la taille un peu petite de la salle d'eau. mais pour quelques jours c'est bien suffisant. Propriétaire très sympathique et très réactif ! La petite attention trouvée à notre arrivée est charmante. Toutes les infos sont disponibles dans un petit guide (conseil. sur restaurants. ville. vélos. etc) qui facilite bien des choses pour un court voyage. La grande flexibilité pour l'arrivée et le départ sont vraiment un plus ! Un logement à conseiller pour découvrir et s'amuser quelques jours à Amsterdam :)
16001180,224073094,2-1-2018,26071666,Emily,Cosy. stylish and close to shops and public transport. Alexander’s flat is truly charming. We made full use of the Netflix. the radio and the fully equipped kitchen and very much appreciated the fresh flowers that were in each room. the lovely welcome message on the chalk board and Alexander’s warm introduction. A fantastic place to stay a little outside of the hustle and bustle of the centre - we truly loved it!
16035172,224046653,2-1-2018,119008263,Sara,La posizione decentrata dell’appartamento è ottimo. sotto casa passa la linea del tram con la quale si raggiungono facilmente i posti di interesse ad Amsterdam.L’appartamento è davvero molto bello e c’è tutto ciò di cui si può avere necessità. dalla cucina al bagno è tutto gestito benissimo.Petra ed August sono due persone davvero disponibili. ci hanno accolto in casa loro e ci hanno anche lasciato il cibo per il primo giorno di soggiorno. davvero molto carini.L’unica pecca sono i letti un po’ scomodi. ma la casa è talmente bella che uno quasi non ci fa neanche caso.Grazie Petra ed August. consiglierò sicuramente la vostra casa ad amici!
16069039,224098417,2-1-2018,110491520,Michael,Clean and spacious home ideal whether you are living there or just using it as a place to just lay your head after exploring the beautiful city it resides in
16081933,223969873,2-1-2018,16568221,Ari,This place was. by far. the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The place has a great king bed with ultra comfy pillows and comforter. The bedroom is separate from a cozy living room that has a perfect TV. The kitchen was equipped with an espresso maker and milk frothed which made the mornings great. They were even fantastic enough to have a bottle of wine. cheese. eggs. and other snacks hat we could eat while in-between the walks to the numerous restaurants right around us. I can’t say enough how great this place was. It even has a little terrace that you can have your morning cappuccino from. Will definitely come back and stay here next time we’re in Amsterdam again!
16095302,224081450,2-1-2018,157503643,Jose Manuel,Calido y confortable apartamento a pocos minutos del centro .

16298977,224088483,2-1-2018,93977347,Josh,Stayed here over the new year and was something me and my partner had really looked forward to for the past few months. However as soon as I opened the door I had a sinking feeling! The decor is much need of freshening up and the bedding. furniture and overall look of the apartment isn’t anywhere as near as nice as the stylish photos. We noticed straight away that there wasn’t a double duvet on the bed just two single duvets. I quickly messaged marteen and he assured me that he would get it changed. Long story short we had the two single duvets all weekend. Marteen did issue us with a €40 refund in which I asked for double however couldn’t be bothered arguing for! I paid £520 for a 4 night stay and am certain I could get a lot better for the same money.
16330136,224051843,2-1-2018,35991637,Michela,Place was a home away from home everything was exactly as expected if not better
16350016,223987745,2-1-2018,13740118,Alex,Kirsten’s place is just what we were looking for - a great space to make our “home base” in Amsterdam. The apartment itself is refreshing. and Kirsten has provided little touches to make her place tranquil and relaxing. It is easy to reach any of Amsterdam’s sights from the apartment’s location. while offering a chance to be away from the hustle and bustle of the City Center. Thanks again. Kirsten!!
16354116,224120002,2-1-2018,47267901,Hessah,Peter was an amazing host! I definitely recommend staying at his place again.

16452536,224061112,2-1-2018,152796196,Caitlin,This is a wonderful apartment to stay in! We had the place to ourselves and it is in a lovely quiet area that is also close to a train station. a bike rental place and a supermarket. It is around a ten minute walk into the nearest train station and then a 5min train ride to Amsterdam Centraal. so is very close to the city. It is a small apartment. but is homely and all the plants add to the atmosphere and it doesn’t feel cramped. The bed is comfortable and everything was clean. Geert was very welcoming and helpful! We arrived earlier than expected. and because he wasn’t expecting us he was still packing to leave. He was very welcoming still and let us leave our bags behind while we explored. He also gave us a few tips before he left and was a lovely person in general. Would 10/10 recommend.
16471009,223951683,2-1-2018,128013987,Stephen,Fantastic location right in the centre of Amsterdam. Great apartment for groups of four people. The place is clean and modern. Highly recommend this apartment. Would definitely stay here again if returning to Amsterdam.

The location was perfect - only 4 stops on the metro from Central Station. which was great since it was absolutely freezing when visiting (we didn't have to walk much). Emiel even left us some Dutch waffles. tea. and some wine to help ourselves to upon our arrival.It was a great stay and I would definitely recommend!

17374776,224031827,2-1-2018,99909765,Louise,Mike had arranged for his friend to meet us on arrival at his flat. Although we were delayed. we were warmly welcomed and shown the facilities. The flat is a very pleasant. easy and relaxed space. set in a residential area. There are 2 small flights of stairs up to the flat front door. The flat is cleverly and stylishly designed. clean and very comfortable. Once you have got to grips with the public bus/tram routes which are very simple (the stop is across the street. a 1 minute walk away). it’s about 20mins into the centre of town. Suggest you buy a 24 or 48hr ticket which will enable you to travel with ease. Mike had left an info sheet on which he mentioned a cafe called (something like). ‘The White Cafe’. Really.... do go! It’s about 1km walk away. a very cool place and serves great coffee. mint/ginger tea and the best apple pie in the world! Mike was always quick to respond to questions and is a kind. generous natured host :))
